# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to the project!

## Getting Started

### System Dependencies

Several system dependencies are required to make contributions to the package.

- [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/) - Runtime version management
- [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) - Project-specific command execution
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Modern Python package management

### Setup Development Environment

To setup the development environment, simply run the included `setup` command.

```bash
just setup
```

This should setup a virtual environment, install necessary development dependencies, and configure development tools.
You can activate the virtual environment by manually sourcing the `activate` script...

```bash
# Bash / Zsh
source .venv/bin/activate

# Fish
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

### Running Tests

All that should be necessary to run tests is to run the included `test` command.

```bash
just test
```

### Running CI

The CI pipeline is run with GitHub Actions and should be triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the repository.
To run the CI pipeline locally, you can execute `tox` directly.

```bash
uv run tox
```
